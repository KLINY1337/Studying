    <h1 id="1">What Is Blockchain Technology?</h1>
    <pre>
<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer" target="_blank">Blockchain</a>, sometimes referred to as <strong><em>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</em></strong>,
makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the
use of a decentralized network and cryptographic hashing.
        
A simple analogy for how blockchain technology operates can be compared
to how a Google Docs document works. When you create a Google Doc and share
it with a group of people, the document is simply distributed instead of
copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain
that gives everyone access to the base document at the same time. No one is
locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to
the document are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely
transparent. A significant gap to note however is that unlike Google Docs,
original content and data on the blockchain cannot be modified once written,
adding to its level of security.

      Why Blockchain Technologies Are So Revolutionary And Important?
    </h2>
    <pre>
Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology because
it helps reduce security risks, stamp out fraud and bring transparency in a scalable way. 

Popularized by its association with cryptocurrency and NFTs, blockchain technology
has since evolved to become a management solution for all types of global industries.
Today, you can find blockchain technology providing transparency for the food
supply chain, securing healthcare data, innovating gaming and overall changing
how we handle data and ownership on a large scale.</pre
    >
    <h1 id="4">How Does Blockchain Work?</h1>
    <pre>
For proof-of-work blockchains, this technologyconsists of three
important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.</pre
    >
    <h3 id="5">What is a Block?</h3>
    <pre>
Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements:
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>The data in the block.</li>
      <li>
        The nonce — “number used only once.” A nonce in blockchain is a <br />
        whole number that’s randomly generated when a block is created,<br />
        which then generates a block header hash.
      </li>
      <li>
        The hash — a hash in blockchain is a number permanently attached to<br />
        the nonce. For Bitcoin hashes, these values must start with a huge<br />
        number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic 
hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce
and hash unless it is mined.</pre
    >
    <h3 id="6">What is a Miner in Blockchain?</h3>
    <pre>
Miners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.

In a blockchain every block has its own unique nonce and hash, but also
references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block
isn't easy, especially on large chains.
      
Miners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem
of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is
only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible
nonce-hash combinations that must be mined before the right one is found.
When that happens miners are said to have found the "golden nonce"
and their block is added to the chain. 
      
Making a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not
just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after.
This is why it's extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology.
Think of it as "safety in math" since finding golden nonces requires
an enormous amount of time and computing power.
      
When a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of
the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.</pre
    >
    <h3 id="7">What is Decentralization in Blockchain?</h3>
    <pre>
One of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is
decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the
chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected
to the chain. Blockchain nodes can be any kind of electronic device
that maintains copies of the chain and keeps the network functioning. 

Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must
algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be
updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent,
every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed, creating
inherent blockchain security. Each participant is given a unique
alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.
      
Combining public information with a system of checks-and-balances
helps the blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users.
Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of
trust via technology.
    </pre>
    <h5>HOW BLOCKCHAIN WORKS</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The blockchain is a digital database, composed of encrypted blocks of<br />
        data which are “chained” together and secured by complex math problems
      </li>
      <li>
        The math problems involving matching nonces and hashes is almost<br />
        impossible to change later — the record of previous actions on the<br />
        blockchain is highly accurate and secure from manipulation
      </li>
      <li>
        The blockchain is distributed identically across different<br />
        decentralized nodes, ensuring no one organization can own or
        <br />manipulate it
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="Assets/Images/Blockchain_use_case.png"
      alt="Blockchain use case."
    />
    <h1 id="8">Blockchain Applications</h1>
    <pre>
Blockchain isn’t only used for financial transactions. Due to its secure
and transparent nature, the technology is versatile to needs beyond one
area of expertise. Industries covering energy, logistics, education and
more are utilizing the benefits of blockchain every day. 
    </pre>
    <h5>TOP BLOCKCHAIN USES AND APPLICATIONS</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Cryptocurrency</li>
      <li>Cybersecurity</li>
      <li>Accounting and record keeping</li>
      <li>Supply chain</li>
      <li>healthcare</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="9">Cryptocurrency: Blockchain vs Cryptocurrency</h1>
    <pre>
Blockchain’s most well-known use (and maybe most controversial) is 
in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies (or tokens),
like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, that can be used to buy goods and
services. Just like a digital form of cash, crypto can be used to buy
everything from your lunch to your next home. Unlike cash, crypto uses
blockchain to act as both a public ledger and an enhanced cryptographic
security system, so online transactions are always recorded and secured.

The term Bitcoin, for example, is used interchangeably to refer to both
the blockchain and the cryptocurrency, but they remain as two separate
entities. The very first blockchain application appeared in 2009 as Bitcoin,
a crypto system using the distributed ledger technology. This also marked
Bitcoin as the first “blockchain.” The aspect of blockchain being used to
house this new digital currency is what brought both entities into
association, and what led them quickly into the spotlight. The Bitcoin
blockchain describes only the technology in which the currency is housed,
while the Bitcoin cryptocurrency describes only the currency itself.
    </pre>
    <h5>HOW DOES CRYPTOCURRENCY WORK?</h5>
    <pre>
Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use 
blockchain technology to record and secure every
transaction. A cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, for example)
can be used as a digital form of cash to pay for
everyday items as well as larger purchases, like
cars and homes. It can be bought using one of
several digital wallets or trading platforms,
then digitally transferred upon purchase of an item,
with the blockchain recording the transaction and
the new owner. The appeal of cryptocurrencies is
that everything is recorded in a public ledger
and secured using cryptography, making an irrefutable,
timestamped and secure record of every payment.</pre
    >
    <pre>
      To date, there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies in the world that have
      a total market cap around $1 trillion, with Bitcoin holding a majority of
      the value. These tokens have become incredibly popular over the last few
      years, with the value of one Bitcoin fluctuating between several thousands
      of dollars. 
      
      Here are some of the main reasons behind cryptocurrency’s recent popularity:
      </pre
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        Blockchain’s security makes theft much harder since each<br />cryptocurrency
        has its own irrefutable identifiable number that is<br />attached to one
        owner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crypto reduces the need for individualized currencies and central<br />
        banks. With blockchain, crypto can be sent to anywhere and anyone in<br />
        the world without the need for currency exchanging or without
        interference<br />
        from central banks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cryptocurrencies can make some people rich. Speculators have been
        driving<br />
        up the price of crypto, especially Bitcoin, helping some early adopters
        to<br />
        become billionaires. Whether this is actually a positive has yet to be
        seen,<br />
        as some retractors believe that speculators do not have the long-term
        benefits<br />
        of crypto in mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        More and more large corporations came around to the idea of a
        blockchain-based<br />
        digital currency for payments. In February 2021, Tesla announced that it
        would<br />
        invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and accept it as payment for their
        cars.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
      Of course, there are many legitimate arguments against blockchain-based
      digital currencies. First, crypto isn’t a very regulated market. Many
      governments were quick to jump into crypto, but few have a staunch set of
      codified laws regarding it. Additionally, crypto is incredibly volatile due
      to speculators. Lack of stability has caused some people to get very rich,
      while a majority have still lost thousands of dollars. 
      
      Whether or not digital currencies are the future remains to be seen. For
      now, it seems as if blockchain’s meteoric rise is more starting to take
      root in reality than pure hype. Though it’s still making headway in this
      entirely-new, highly-exploratory field, blockchain is also showing
      promise beyond Bitcoin.</pre
    >
    <h2 id="10">What is a Blockchain Platform?</h2>
    <pre>
While a blockchain network describes the distributed ledger infrastructure, a
blockchain platform describes a medium where users can interact with a blockchain
and its network. Blockchain platforms are created to be scalable and act as
extensions from an existing blockchain infrastructure, allowing information
exchange and services to be powered directly from this framework. 

An example of a blockchain platform includes Ethereum, a software platform which
houses the Etherium, or ether, cryptocurrency. With the Ethereum platform, users
can also create programmable tokens and smart contracts which are built directly
upon the Ethereum blockchain infrastructure.
